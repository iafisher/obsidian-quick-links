# Obsidian Quick Links
Create shortcuts to quickly link to external sites in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

For example, you can link to "New York City" on Wikipedia by writing `[[w:New York City]]`.

You can also define your own custom shortcuts. For instance, you could create a `twitter:` prefix to link to a Twitter profile with `[[twitter:some-twitter-handle]]`.

## Development
- `npm run dev` to build in dev mode and automatically rebuild on changes.
- `npm run build` to build in prod mode and run the type-checker.
